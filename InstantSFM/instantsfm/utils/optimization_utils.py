def refine_optimization_inputs(inputs_dict, verbose=True):
    """
    Refines and validates inputs before passing them to the BAE (Bundle Adjustment Engine) optimizer.
    
    This utility serves as a centralized fix for a known issue in the BAE library where optimization 
    fails for 1x1 blocks (scalar variables).
    
    Key Operations:
    1. **Diagnostic Logging**: Optionally prints the shapes and data types of all input tensors to help 
       debug shape mismatches or type errors (e.g., float32 vs float64).
    2. **BAE Workaround (Padding)**: Detects tensors with shape (N, 1) and pads them to (N, 2) by 
       appending a column of zeros.
       - **Why?** The BAE solver's block management logic has a bug when handling single-scalar blocks. 
         Padding them to size 2 bypasses this specific code path.
       - **Implication**: Downstream cost functions (e.g., `pairwise_cost`, `reproject_simple_pinhole`) 
         must be aware of this padding. They should typically use the first column as the actual variable 
         and the second column as a "dummy" variable (multiplied by 0) to satisfy `torch.vmap` 
         gradient tracing requirements without affecting the cost.

    Args:
        inputs_dict (dict): A dictionary mapping variable names (str) to PyTorch tensors.
                            Example: {"scales": tensor(N, 1), "points": tensor(N, 3)}
        verbose (bool): If True, prints diagnostic information to stdout. Default is True.
        
    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary containing the refined tensors. Tensors that were (N, 1) are now (N, 2).
              Tensors that were None are preserved as None.

        # ==================================================================================
        # The BAE autograd engine (specifically `torch.vmap` in `bae/autograd/graph.py`) 
        # fails to correctly vectorize Jacobians for parameters with shape (N, 1).

        #
        # Solution: We pad these tensors to (N, 2). The second column acts as a "dummy" 
        # variable. This forces the block size to be > 1, bypassing the buggy code path.
